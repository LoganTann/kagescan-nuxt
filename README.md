# Kagescan.fr but using nuxt and supabase - Proof of concept

Currently, the only goal is to create the CMS editor (kagescan translations workspace).

Therefore, the software architecture is not made to be perfect.

This project uses [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).

**Composition or Options ?** : Since I'm learning Nuxt 3, I try to use as much as possible the Composition API. However, the Options API is definitely more intuitive so don't be surprised if I use it.
